> "People say that intellect is what makes a great scientist.  
> They’re wrong: it’s character."  
> — Prof. Albert Einstein  

> "In the field of science and mathematics, empirical or abstract changes are measured using units. Just as in physics the unit of mechanical force is the Newton, Production Engineering also has its own unit: throughput.  
> According to the Theory of Constraints, the rate at which a system achieves its goals is called throughput.  
> Success in achieving these goals will be limited by a series of constraints. Therefore, by focusing on one of them, the engineer can propose a solution or restructuring suited to a particular context or problem."

> This is what i do best, convert data into information for decision making.
