> "People say that intellect is what makes a great scientist.  
> They’re wrong: it’s character."  
> — Prof. Albert Einstein  

> "In science and mathematics, changes are measured in units.  
> Just as force is measured in Newtons, Production Engineering measures success through **throughput** — the rate at which a system achieves its goals.  
> By focusing on constraints, the engineer designs solutions that truly work."

> This is what I do best: convert **data** into **information** for decision-making.
