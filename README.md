"People say that intellect is what makes a great scientist.  
They’re wrong: it’s character."  
— Prof. Albert Einstein  

"In science and mathematics, changes are measured in units.  
Just as force is measured in Newtons, Production Engineering measures success through **throughput** — the rate at which a system achieves its goals.  
By focusing on constraints, the engineer designs solutions that truly work."

This is what I do best: convert **data** into **information** for decision-making.
