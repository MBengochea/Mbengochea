 "People say that intellect is what makes a great scientist.  
 They’re wrong: it’s character."  
 — Prof. Albert Einstein  

"In science and mathematics, changes are measured in units.  
Just as force is measured in Newtons, Production Engineering measures success through **throughput** — the rate at which a system achieves its goals. By focusing on constraints, the engineer designs solutions that truly work."

This is what I do best: convert **data** into **information** for business decision-making.
